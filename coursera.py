#Problem 1_1:
#Write a function problem1_1() that prints "Problem Set 1".
#def problem1_1():
    #print("problem set 1")
#problem1_1()


#Problem 1_2:
#Write a function problem1_2(x,y) that prints the sum and product of the
#numbers x and y on separate lines, the sum printing first
# def problem1_2(x,y):
#     sum= x + y
#     print('the sum of x and y =', sum)
#     product= x * y
#     print('product of the numbers x and y=', product)
# problem1_2(3,5)


#Problem 1_3:  
#Write a function problem1_3(n) that adds up the numbers 1 through n and
#prints out the result. You should use either a 'while' loop or a 'for' loop.
#Be sure that you check your answer on several numbers n.  Be careful that your
#loop steps through all the numbers from 1 through and including n

# def problem1_3(n):
    
# Problem 1_4:
# Write a function 'problem1_4(miles)' to convert miles to feet. There are
# 5280 feet in each mile. Make the print out a statement as follows:
# "There are 10560 feet in 2 miles."  Except for the numbers this statement 
# should be exactly as written.



# def problem1_4(miles):
#     feet = 5280 * miles 
#     print("There are", feet, "feet in", miles, "miles.")

# problem1_4(5)

Problem 1_5:
Write a function 'problem1_5(age)'. This function should use if-elif-else
statement to print out "Have a glass of milk." for anyone under 7; "Have
a coke." for anyone under 21, and "Have a martini." for anyone 21 or older.
